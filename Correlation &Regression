First, copy table from Excel. Then to read data:  
> taxas <- read.table(file = "clipboard", sep = "\t", header=TRUE)  
> taxas

 If you want to view the data  
> edit(taxas)

**Correlation analysis**  
> cor(taxas[6:16])   
*Omit column 1 because it contains participant id numbers*  

## Teste de normalidade Shapiro-Wilk
> shapiro.test(JP$freq_fournier)

**Shows significance**  
> cor.test(taxas$agonismo, taxas$pluviom, method = c("spearman"))

**Differents types of correlation tests**
> cor.test(x, y,
         alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"),
         method = c("pearson", "kendall", "spearman"),
         exact = NULL, conf.level = 0.95, continuity = FALSE, ...)  
**Arguments**
-x, y	
*numeric vectors of data values. x and y must have the same length.*
-alternative	
*indicates the alternative hypothesis and must be one of "two.sided", "greater" or "less". You can specify just the initial letter. "greater" corresponds to positive association, "less" to negative association.*
-method	
*a character string indicating which correlation coefficient is to be used for the test. One of "pearson", "kendall", or "spearman", can be abbreviated.*
-exact	
*a logical indicating whether an exact p-value should be computed. Used for Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho. See ‘Details’ for the meaning of NULL (the default).*
-conf.level	
*confidence level for the returned confidence interval. Currently only used for the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient if there are at least 4 complete pairs of observations.*
-continuity	
*logical: if true, a continuity correction is used for Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho when not computed exactly.*
